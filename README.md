# Gym_management_System (Java Console App)

This is a simple Gym Management System developed in Java as a console-based application.  
The project is currently being migrated from a basic Java structure to a Maven-based architecture, and will later be upgraded to use Spring Boot for a complete backend system.

## Features (Current Phase)

- Member Registration
- Member Login
- Basic Membership Management (Add, View, Delete)
- Console-based interface
- MySQL database integration for storing member data

## Tech Stack

- Java
- Maven (in progress)
- MySQL (via JDBC)
- Git for version control

## What's Next

- Migrate the code to Spring Boot and expose RESTful APIs
- Add better error handling and validation
- Implement Authentication & Authorization
- Create a simple frontend (maybe with React or Thymeleaf)
- Dockerize the project for deployment

## How to Run (Current Console Version)

1. Clone the repo:
2. Import it as a Maven project in your IDE (e.g., IntelliJ, Eclipse)

3. Set up your MySQL database:
- Create a database (e.g., gym_db)
- Update DB connection info in the code (username/password)

4. Run the Main.java file

## Status

This project is under active development.  
Current goal: Transition to Spring Boot backend with full REST support.
